Z-fighting happens when you have a low Depth Bit Quantization and the 2 parallel primitives are close together, causing the code
to be unable to detect the depht difference and then not choosing the right primitive to render. You can see this effect by 
setting the Depth Bit Quantization to minimum and enabling Depth Test: pass greater. The test will fail and will get the lesser
depth primitive instead.
