Testing with small values, we can notice that the specular highlight 
tends to move to the left of the center, because the calculations are 
made segment by segment and starts on the leftmost point of the segment.
With phong shading, we are interpolating normals, so with that we can 
calculate the lighting on every fragment individually, instead of a set 
of points, thus getting a smoother and more correct lighting.
